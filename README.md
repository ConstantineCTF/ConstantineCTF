# Constantine  

**Offensive Security Researcher | Advanced Red Team Operator**  

I execute sophisticated threat simulations and offensive security research against enterprise infrastructures. My work identifies architectural vulnerabilities and exploitation paths that standard assessment methodologies cannot detect.  I utilize Go to engineer solutions when operational precision exceeds the capabilities of existing frameworks.
