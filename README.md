# Constantine  

**Cloud Offensive Security Researcher | Private Cloud Red Team Specialist**  

I execute advanced threat simulations against cloud infrastructures, identifying architectural vulnerabilities in private (OpenStack) and public (AWS/Azure) cloud environments that traditional assessments miss. I develop Go-based tooling to weaponize novel attack paths when existing frameworks lack operational precision.

## Expertise

**Cloud Red Team Operations**  
Full-spectrum offensive campaigns against hybrid cloud environments—from initial access in tenant workloads to complete infrastructure compromise. Specialized in private cloud (OpenStack) and multi-cloud (AWS/Azure) attack surface exploitation.

**Cloud Architecture Exploitation**  
Discovery and weaponization of systemic weaknesses in cloud identity systems (Keystone, IAM, Azure AD), inter-service trust relationships, and hypervisor-layer vulnerabilities. Focus on privilege escalation chains that bypass traditional security controls.

**Offensive Cloud Tool Development**  
Custom Go tooling for cloud-specific exploitation: metadata service abuse, storage layer subversion, network dominance, and hypervisor escape. Tools designed for memory-only execution with zero forensic footprint.

**Private Cloud Security Research**  
Deep analysis of OpenStack internals—Keystone token mechanics, Nova hypervisor interfaces, Cinder storage protocols, Neutron networking flows. Research focused on architectural exploitation rather than configuration scanning.

## Track Record

Built and compromised production-grade OpenStack private clouds from scratch, demonstrating full infrastructure takeover via metadata service exploitation and hypervisor-layer attacks.

Identified critical attack paths in default OpenStack deployments leading to complete tenant isolation bypass.

Research on cloud-native privilege escalation chains adopted by professional red teams for cloud engagement methodologies.

Development of memory-resident exploitation frameworks for cloud environments with advanced detection capabilities.
